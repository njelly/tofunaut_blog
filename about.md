My name is Nathaniel Ellingson, I am a software engineer from Salt Lake City, and I love computers as a medium for expression. I make video games professionally. This website is intended as a portfolio showcase, a mind-dump of things Iâ€™m interested in, and a place for me to experiment with web development.
