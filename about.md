My name is Nathaniel Ellingson, I am a software engineer from Salt Lake City, and I make video games both professionally and as a hobbyist. I love computers as a medium for expression. This website is intended as a portfolio showcase, a mind-dump of opinions and things Iâ€™m interested in, and a place for me to experiment with web development.
