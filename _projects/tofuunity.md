TofuUnity is an open source collection of scripts and frameworks that I started working on in September 2019. I use these scripts in my personal projects, which are the main driver behind any updates and bug-fixes. It is available to use under the MIT license. You can read more about it on the repoâ€™s GitHub homepage.
