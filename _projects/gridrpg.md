GridRPG is a project I am working on in Unity, and is inspired by games like Pokemon and Fire Emblem. More information, including a design wiki and source code for the majority of the game code, is [available on the project's homepage on GitHub][repo-link].

I hope to use develop this game publicly to show my process for others to use as a reference when building their own games in Unity. However, because parts of the code base exist in private submodules, this isn't technically "open-source." I'd still like to have the option to release the game commerically in the future. ;)
