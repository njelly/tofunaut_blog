Ludum Dare 44 was the first Game Jam I participated in. The theme was "your life is currency" so I created a tower-defense game where the player spends health to build towers. As the player's towers rack up kills, they can click on a tower to sacrifice it, regaining one point of health for each kill that tower made. There is no win-state, although eventually the player will become over powered with more than enough health to fill the screen with towers.

The game was made with Unity and built for WebGL. Pixel art was created with Aseprite.
