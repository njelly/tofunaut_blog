TofuUnity is a project I am working on to consolidate a lot of the scripts and frameworks I use. Included in the repo is the SharpUnity framework, which I am developing with the goal that it will be able to completely replace the typical programmer's workflow in Unity. You can read more about it on [the repo's homepage on GitHub][github-link].

I plan on starting a game project soon that will utilize these scripts. I’m thinking I'll pitch it as a “sandbox RPG.” Neat.
