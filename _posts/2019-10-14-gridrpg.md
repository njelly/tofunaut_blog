GridRPG is a project I am working on in Unity, and is inspired by games like Pokemon and Fire Emblem. More information, including a design wiki and source code for the majority of the game code, is [available on the project's homepage on GitHub][repo-link].

I hope to develop this game publicly in order to show my process and for others to use it as a reference when creating their own games. However, because parts of the code base exist in private submodules, this isn't technically "open-source." I'd still like to have the option to release the game commerically in the future. ;)
