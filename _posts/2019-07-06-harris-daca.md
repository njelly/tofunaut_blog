(jump to 7:30 in the video for the relevant question)

There's only one answer to the question asked about DACA, nothing else matters: all people in the world deserve a safe place in America. We are hypocrites the moment we start putting any standard whatsoever on who is allowed to become "American." We don't need "immigration reform" we need more immigrants, period. Every single person searching for a better life should come here. Everyone in the world. If you make the journey to cross the border than you have done more to become "American" than most people ever will.

America is not natural, it is what we make it. We can choose to have racist immigration laws or we can choose to use our wealth to protect the most vulnerable people in the world: people without homes, who have fled their country with nothing but a desperate hope that we will treat them better than the oppressors they are escaping.

Kamala Harris appears to be a “good” candidate. Her problematic history in law enforcement denies her any credibility when speaking of ending the war on drugs or the epidemic of mass incarceration, but anyone looks good in contrast to the incumbent Fascist party candidate. Her ineffectual lip service to the concept of “comprehensive immigration reform” means nothing if it isn’t backed up by a sincere respect for the humanity of every person coming here.

Compromise is a dirty word. The other side will not defend your rights, there is nothing gained by pretending their opinions deserve equal deference. Democratic candidates must stand with people, workers, and the poor, regardless of the status of their citizenship, or they must get out of the race, now.
