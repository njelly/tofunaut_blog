Getting here wasn’t easy. I had to endure litteral minutes of DNS debugging, HTTPS privacy errors, learning about a tool called jekyll, all while I could have spent my time doing something more psychologically productive like going outside on the first warm weekend of summer.

I’d like to thank [this guy][youtube-tutorial] for making a neat youtube tutorial series on jekyll.

[This guy][medium-post] for writing a Medium post about using a custom domain from Google Domains with GitHub Pages.

And Hayao Miyazaki for giving me this sick ass wallpaper to stare at all day:
